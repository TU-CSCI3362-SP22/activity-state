# State Pattern:
## Virtual capsule machine with user-uploadable capsule machine sets
- Based off of example of gumball machine from Head First Design Patterns (Eric Freeman, Elisabeth Robson)
- random number of uploaded image duplication in the the capsul machine, randomizing chances of user-uploaded "gumballs"
- Rarity printout sheet with the rarest files in the machine

Non-refactored codebase - icky and gross conditionals. Activity will be to refactor it to no longer have icky and gross conditionals and to put things into classes

### States:
 - No Image to Upload
 - Image to Upload
 - Out of gumballs
 - Gumball Dispensed
